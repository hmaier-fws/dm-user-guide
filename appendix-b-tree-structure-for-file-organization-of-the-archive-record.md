# Appendix B: Tree Structure for File Organization of the Archive Record

_Descriptions or details of the file/folder given in parentheses._&#x20;

**root** (project name; takes the format ProgramAcronym\_SequentialNumber\_ShortTitle, e.g., MBMWA\_011\_YKDeltaNestPlot would stand for the Migratory Bird Management Waterfowl Program, YK  Delta Nest Plot Survey, and it was the 11th archive record created for that program)

* **changelog.txt** (text file for the data custodian to record activities in the archive record)
* **admin** (material related to general project administration; could be replicated each year for multiyear projects, i.e., admin2019, admin2020)
  * **contracts**
  * **correspondence** (including permits obtained for the project)
  * **proposals** (those prepared for both internal or external   funding)
  * **purchasing** (significant or unique purchasing information that is deemed important to archive)
  * **training** (training materials developed for the project)
  * **travel** (significant or unique travel information that is deemed important to archive)
* **code** (R or Python scripts, for example)
* **data** (data generated from the project)
  * **raw\_data** (unprocessed data as initially recorded; structure will vary by project; recommended to organize data by datatype)
    * **raw\_type\_of\_data\_x**
      * csv
    * **raw\_type\_of\_data\_y (repeat as needed)**
      * images/text notes/ sounds/geo points or lines/etc
  * **final\_data** (data that has passed all quality control checks and are typically the data products documented in metadata records; generally data used for analysis; structure will mirror that of the raw\_data folder)
    * **final\_type\_of\_data\_x**
      * csv
    * **final\_type\_of\_data\_y (repeat as needed)**
      * images/text notes/ sounds/geo points or lines/etc
* **documents** (materials generated by the project; these products are also documented in metadata)
  * **images** (stand-alone posters, maps, drawings, pictures)
  * **publications** (peer reviewed)
  * **reports** (not peer reviewed)
  * **talks** (presentations)
* **incoming** (holding location for materials that should be filed under one of the other branches after review by the data steward)
* **metadata** (contains the mdEditor JSON file for the project, associated products, project contacts, and data dictionaries)
* **protocols** (methods and protocol documents that guide project procedures)
  * **form\_template** (data sheets, templates for data entry, etc)
* **source\_data** (data NOT generated by the project but used during the course of the project; could include data used to design the project)
  * **source\_type\_of\_data\_x**
    * raw\_data.csv&#x20;
  * **source\_type\_of\_data\_y** (repeat as needed)
    * images/text notes/sounds/geo points or lines/etc.&#x20;      &#x9;
