# Definition of Project and Product (aka Data Resources)

The interim plan is focused on projects and their derived products. Projects are discrete efforts on a particular topic with defined objectives or goals. At this time, programs determine which projects (completed, ongoing, or proposed) should undergo data management. For example, use in management decisions and partner needs may be criteria managers could adopt to prioritize projects for data management.&#x20;

Products (aka Data Resources) are recorded information generated by experiments, models, simulations, observations, analysis, and other activities that create or synthesize data resources. In a new project, anticipated products are identified during the planning stage when the design of sampling and analysis take place in consultation with the programâ€™s biometrician. Determining which products to document is at the discretion of the principal investigator, their supervisor, and any relevant program or branch policies but guided by the principle of reuse.
