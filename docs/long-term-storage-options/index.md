# Long-term Storage Options



Archiving project data and their associated metadata is critical for preserving your work and legacy in the Service. Proper archiving mitigates the risk of data loss, eases access to current and historic data, and enables convenient data sharing. There are several long-term storage options available to Alaska Region staff to safekeep project files:

1. [Alaska Regional Data Repository](broken-reference), which is a shared internal drive accessible to Service staff.
2. [Public-facing repositories](broken-reference) such as [ServCat](https://ecos.fws.gov/ServCat/) and [ScienceBase](https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/).

While the type of short-term storage used is at the project leader's full discretion, all data **must** eventually be stored within a FWS repository.
