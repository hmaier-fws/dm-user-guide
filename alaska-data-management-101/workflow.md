#### _#1: Complete a Data Management Plan_ <a href="#step-1-create-data-management-plan" id="step-1-create-data-management-plan"></a>

Data Management Plan (DMPs) serves as your data communication document with project staff and your data manager on data collection procedures, quality control practices, working files storage, and distribution preferences. One DMP option is the Alaska Region [machine-readable DMP template](broken-reference) that can be used to automatically initiate metadata records.

Even if you have started writing metadata, you should complete a DMP, if you have not done so.&#x20;

If your project is ongoing (ie. annual survey), and you have already completed a DMP, please just take a moment to confirm that nothing has changed. &#x20;

#### _#2: Complete your PROJECT Metadata Record_ <a href="#step-2-initiate-metadata-record" id="step-2-initiate-metadata-record"></a>

If you used the [machine-readable DMP template](broken-reference), you will have a Project metadata record populated from the fields in your DMP ready for updating in [mdEditor](https://www.mdeditor.org/) where records can be updated.  Needed updates will likely include adding GCMD keywords, taxonomy, and spatial extent, if not provided in the DMP.  See the [project metadata creation](broken-reference) section of this guidance to ensure that your project metadata meets the regional requirements.&#x20;

If your are starting your metadata from scratch, this [training video](https://web.microsoftstream.com/video/30e18ae9-55bd-4d1c-a3aa-971089c88004) can help you get started.  Also, see the [project metadata creation](broken-reference) section in this guide.

#### _#3: Collect and Clean your Data_ <a href="#step-3-tidy-up-data" id="step-3-tidy-up-data"></a>

After acquiring your data, prepare your data for re-use.  This means that the data tables are tidy, open source, and have passed quality control checks.  Tidy data means that each column is a type of data, each row is a single data entry, and values are present throughout the table.  For more tips on tidy data, check out this [training video](https://web.microsoftstream.com/video/63c21ffc-4359-4ed9-b23b-6b549c993f4a). Also see the [Quality Management](broken-reference) and [Acquire section](broken-reference) of this guidance.

Don't forget to prepare a data dictionary that defines your column names, measurement units, and any codes found in the dataset.  This is necessary for others to be able to understand the data.

#### _#4: Complete your data PRODUCT metadata_ <a href="#step-4-publish-data-with-a-digital-object-identifier" id="step-4-publish-data-with-a-digital-object-identifier"></a>

Once your data is cleaned, complete your data product metadata.  If you included the dataset in your DMP, you have a data Product metadata record ready to be completed.  See the [product metadata creation](broken-reference) section of this guide.  Both raw data and final, clean data should be documented with metadata.

When your metadata is complete, ask your data manager if a persistent identifiers is appropriate for you project or products.  A [Digital Object Identifier](broken-reference) is one persistent identifier option.  This is essentially a Social Security number for your dataset.  It creates a permanent citation link for your data so that it can be referenced in reports, publications, or larger data analysis, in addition to making your data more discoverable.

#### _#5: Store Data and Metadata_ <a href="#step-5-store-data-and-metadata" id="step-5-store-data-and-metadata"></a>

Your data and completed metadata is required to be made publicly available.  The [Alaska Regional Data Repository](https://ak-region-dst.gitbook.io/alaska-region-interim-data-management-user-guide/four-fundamental-activities-of-data-management/security-and-preservation) is a regional home for the preservation of Alaska authoritative data and completed metadata.  Use of the RDR enables data managers to access and share your metadata and data with public repositories as appropriate.

{% hint style="danger" %}
Currently, FWS does not have approved data repositories for Service-wide use. &#x20;
{% endhint %}

**#6: Share metadata and data publicly**

Policy requires that the authoritative copy is maintained on a FWS system, but a COPY of metadata and data may be shared with internal and external catalogs and repositories as desired.  After the completed metadata and data are deposited in the RDR, consult with your program data manager to identify where the data may be appropriately shared publicly. &#x20;
