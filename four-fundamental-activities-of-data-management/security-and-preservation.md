# Security and Preservation

Establishing a single archive folder for each project prevents data loss and ensures data integrity. The archive folder for a project, comprised of the recommended file structure ([Appendix B](broken-reference)) and described in [File Organization and Best Practices](../acquire/file-organization-and-best-practices/) section, will be placed in the Regional Data Repository. See [File Organization and Best Practices](../acquire/file-organization-and-best-practices/) for details on setting up an archive folder for your project.&#x20;

The [Data Custodian](establish-roles-and-responsibilities.md) will have write permissions to all folders in the archive folder. The [Project Manager](establish-roles-and-responsibilities.md) and [Data Originators](establish-roles-and-responsibilities.md) will have write permissions to an “incoming” folder and read-only permissions to all other folders. All other staff in the Region will have read-only access to the entire folder. The incoming folder allows project personnel to contribute products and associated metadata records to the archive folder. The [Data Steward](establish-roles-and-responsibilities.md) is responsible for reviewing these files and the [Data Custodian](establish-roles-and-responsibilities.md) is responsible for moving them from the incoming folder to the appropriate folder in the archive folder.

::: {.callout-note}
Anyone with access to the Regional Data Repository can copy an archive folder to their local hard drive and maintain the files on their hard drive in whatever manner they choose, but only project personnel may move things into their project's archive folder via the incoming folder.
