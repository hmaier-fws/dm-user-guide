# Best Practices with Source Data

Source&#x20;data refers to those data resources used by the project but not created by the project. Source data is commonly used as input in the creation of new data products. Examples include base layers used in GIS processing or sensor input used to generate analytical output. If the source data is discoverable and permanently accessible through another means (e.g. USGS Streamflow data), this data does not need to be maintained in a project archive folder. However, if the source data is not readily available in the form used by the project it would be appropriate to save that information in the archive folder by following the best practices for each data type as described in prior sections of this guide.

â€ŒIn either case, a metadata record for the source data, obtained from the original source or written in the mdEditor, must be in the source data folder of the archive. The relationship between source data and products are described in the [Lineage section](https://app.gitbook.com/@ak-region-dst/s/alaska-region-mdeditor-interim-user-guide/product-entry-guidance/lineage-tab) of the product metadata record.\
