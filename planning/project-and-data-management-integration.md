# Project & Data Management Integration

Project management is the application of knowledge, skills, tools, and techniques to oversee a project to completion in the desired time and to a specified quality.  Data management is concerned with the handling of data to ensure long-lasting integrity and usability.  Despite the fundamental difference, project management and data management lifecycles work in tandem. Data management is most effective when fully integrated into project workflows, project oversight, and staff supervision (i.e., project management).
