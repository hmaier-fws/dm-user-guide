# Considerations for Projects with External Partners

Data collected through Service-funded MOU, cooperative agreements, or contracts with external agencies must follow all applicable data management policy requirements. Staff are responsible for ensuring that contracts and agreements awarded to non-Service entities to collect, distribute, or manage data for the Service do the following:&#x20;

1\) specify data management and stewardship responsibility,

2\) identify any restrictions on use,

3\) describe preservation responsibilities,

4\) ensure that the Service maintains access to the data, and&#x20;

5\) incorporate applicable requirements from the data management policy (i.e., the creation of data management plans).

This section will be updated when specific guidance for including data management in contracts is developed.
