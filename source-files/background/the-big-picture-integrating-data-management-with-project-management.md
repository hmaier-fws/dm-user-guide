# The Big Picture: Integrating Data Management with Project Management

Project management and data management are different. Project management is the application of knowledge, skills, tools, and techniques to oversee a project to completion in the desired time and to a specified quality. Data management is concerned with the handling of data to ensure long-lasting integrity and usability. The figure below shows the relationship between the project and data management life cycles. Data management is most effective when fully integrated into project workflows, project oversight, and staff supervision (i.e., project management). The purpose of this document is to provide knowledge and guidance for the data management aspect of projects. Guidance on project management is beyond the scope of this document.
