Use the [mdEditor](https://www.mdeditor.org) to write metadata or data about the data. mdEditor is a web-based application developed by the Alaska Data Integration Working Group [(ADIwg](https://www.adiwg.org/about/)) that allows data-generators to write archival-quality metadata without specialized technical knowledge. Metadata writers [export mdEditor JSON files](https://app.gitbook.com/@ak-region-dst/s/alaska-region-mdeditor-interim-user-guide/file-management/export) to the incoming folder in the project archive. Data Custodians review these records and move them to the metadata folder in the project archive.

â€ŒEarly adopters unfamiliar with mdEditor should first complete the [mdEditor Tutorial](https://guide.mdeditor.org/tutorial/welcome-to-tutorial.html) to become acquainted with the layout and functionality of the application. The [Alaska Region Metadata Guide](https://ak-region-dst.gitbook.io/alaska-region-mdeditor-interim-user-guide/) provides additional region-specific guidance. Contact a member of the DST to learn about other training opportunities, such as hands-on workshops.

As a quick checklist, information to gather for a metadata record includes:

* Title
* [Roles and responsibilities](establish-roles-and-responsibilities.md)
* Contact information for project staff
* Abstract
* Start date
* End date
* Keywords
* Focal species in the project
* Spatial extent
* [Data dictionaries](https://doimspp.sharepoint.com/:x:/s/AlaskaDataStewardship/EV4M7\_juM5FOgGm9r\_hWiOABsJDdLPaPQG0Bmm4sja5fsQ?e=wznkFo) (for some product types)
* Protocols used in the project
